# text-to-speech
Telegram bot. Turns yours text message into a voice message.

This time I used the library ffmpeg-python, so installing the plugin is not required. It is enough to install the library via pip.

What is this bot for? idk, but the idea was - user can train his pronunciation using this bot, or use for voicing articles.
btw u can use this code as an example work with used libraries.
